  "annotation": "The user wants to find the surface area of a frustum. The frustum is formed by removing a smaller cone from a larger cone. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the top and bottom circular bases, plus the lateral area of the frustum (which is the lateral area of the large cone minus the lateral area of the small cone). All necessary dimensions (diameters of both bases and the slant heights of both the small cone and the frustum) are provided in the image and text.",
