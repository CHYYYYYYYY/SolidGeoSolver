  "annotation": "The user wants to find the length of the line segment CX in a triangular prism. The problem provides dimensions for the prism. The key is to identify the right-angled triangle CXF within the rectangular face CDEF and use the Pythagorean theorem. The length of CF is given, and XF can be deduced from the fact that X is the midpoint of EF, and EF has the same length as AB/CD.",
