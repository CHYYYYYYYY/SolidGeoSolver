  "annotation": "The user provided an image of a cube but the text describes a right pyramid. The text is inconsistent with the image. The text mentions points V, A, W and an angle theta, which are not present in the image. The image shows a cube with side length 7cm, while the text mentions a square base with side length 12cm. I will follow the image's information as it is more concrete and the text seems to be from a different problem.",
