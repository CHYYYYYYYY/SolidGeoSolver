  "annotation": "The user wants to find the surface area of a right prism with a trapezoidal base. The dimensions of the trapezoid are given as two parallel vertical sides of 10 cm and 3 cm, and a bottom base of 13 cm. The length of the prism is not explicitly stated, but the text mentions a 'right rectangle surface' with an edge of 10cm. This implies the prism's length is also 10cm, making the left face a 10x10 square. The goal is to calculate the total surface area.",
