  "annotation": "Let the cone be C1, with its base being circle O1. The height of the cone is given as 12, and the busbar (slant height) is given as 13. Let r be the radius of the base. For a right circular cone, the height, radius, and busbar form a right-angled triangle with the busbar as the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, height^2 + radius^2 = busbar^2. Substituting the given values, we get 12^2 + r^2 = 13^2, which simplifies to 144 + r^2 = 169. Solving for r^2, we find r^2 = 169 - 144 = 25. Therefore, the radius r = sqrt(25) = 5. The problem asks for the length of the diameter of the cone's base, which is twice the radius. Diameter = 2 * r = 2 * 5 = 10.",
