  "annotation": "The problem asks for the surface area of an L-shaped prism. The image provides the dimensions of the L-shaped face and the text provides the thickness (height) of the prism. The L-shape can be decomposed into two rectangles. One rectangle is 17cm by 8cm. The other rectangle has one side of 4cm. The total height of the L-shape is 16cm, so the other side of the second rectangle is 16cm - 8cm = 8cm. The total width is 17cm, so the other side of the first rectangle is 17cm - 4cm = 13cm. Let's define the vertices. Let the front face be ABCDEF where A is the top-left corner, B is the inner corner, C is the top-right corner, D is the bottom-right corner, E is the bottom-left corner, and F is the point on the left edge such that AF=8. The back face will be GHIJKL. The thickness is 3cm. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the two L-shaped faces and the areas of the six rectangular side faces.",
