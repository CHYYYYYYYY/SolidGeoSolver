The radii of the tops of the liquid surfaces are $3 \\text{ cm}$ and $6 \\text{ cm}$. Into each cone is dropped a spherical marble of radius $1 \\text{ cm}$, which sinks to the bottom and is completely submerged without spilling any liquid. What is the ratio of the rise of the liquid level in the narrow cone to the rise of the liquid level in the wide cone?\n<image1> A. 1:1\n B. 47:43\n C. 2:1\n D. 40:13\n E. 4:1\n",
