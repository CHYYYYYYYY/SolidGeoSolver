Tank $X$ has a base of area of $200 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.\nTank $Y$ has a base of area $100 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and height $7 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Sol has partly filled Tank X to a depth of $5 \\mathrm{~cm}$. He then places Tank Y, which is empty, on the bottom of Tank X. The water in Tank X rises, of course, and spills over into in Tank Y.
